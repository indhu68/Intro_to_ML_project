# Age group Prediction from Voice Data  - Intoduction to Machine learning research project

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting the **age group** of a speaker using **voice data**. The methodology involves both **classical machine learning (ML)** and **neural network-based approaches** to analyze audio features and predict the age category. The study evaluates and compares various models, including **Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.

This project was developed as part of the **ECGR 5105 - Machine Learning** coursework at the **University of North Carolina Charlotte**.

## Introduction  
Voice carries hidden patterns that reveal a speaker‚Äôs **age, emotion, and identity**. Estimating age from voice has applications in **security, forensic analysis, AI-driven personalization, and healthcare**. This project explores how well different **machine learning and deep learning models** can predict age groups based on extracted **audio features**.

By implementing **classical ML models** and **deep learning architectures**, we compare their effectiveness and gain insights into the most suitable approach for age prediction from voice recordings.

## Approach & Methodology  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Classical Machine Learning Models**  
For traditional ML, we extract **23 audio features**, including:  
- **Spectral Features**: Spectral Centroid, Spectral Bandwidth, Spectral Rolloff  
- **Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)**: mfcc1 to mfcc20  
- **Other Features**: Chroma, Spectral Contrast, Tonnetz, RMS Energy  

Using these features, we train and evaluate:  
- **Logistic Regression** ‚Äì Establishes a baseline for classification.  
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with RBF Kernel** ‚Äì Captures complex, non-linear relationships in voice data.  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** ‚Äì Works well for localized pattern recognition.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Neural Network Models**  
For deep learning, we extract **191 audio features** to capture intricate patterns in voice recordings. We implement:  
- **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)** ‚Äì Uses multiple dense layers to model age-related patterns.  
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** ‚Äì Utilizes **residual blocks** to extract hierarchical relationships from spectrograms.

## Dataset & Feature Extraction  
- **Dataset:** Mozilla Common Voice Dataset ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/))  
- **Feature Extraction:** `Librosa` Python library for extracting **MFCCs, spectral features, chroma, and energy-based attributes**.

We process the dataset by:  
- Splitting it into **training (80%) and testing (20%)** datasets.  
- Encoding the labels using `LabelEncoder` from `scikit-learn` for ML models.  
- Converting data to `PyTorch` tensors for deep learning models.
